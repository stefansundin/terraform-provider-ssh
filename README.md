### terraform-provider-ssh

This provider enables SSH port forwarding in Terraform. It is intended as a
bandaid [until it is supported in Terraform itself](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/8367).

**Note: Terraform v0.12 support is highly experimental!**

#### Example

See [main.tf](main.tf).

#### Installation

On Linux:

```shell
mkdir -p terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64
wget https://github.com/stefansundin/terraform-provider-ssh/releases/download/v0.0.4/terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_linux_amd64.zip -d terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64
rm terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_linux_amd64.zip
terraform init
```

On Mac:

```shell
mkdir -p terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64
wget https://github.com/stefansundin/terraform-provider-ssh/releases/download/v0.0.4/terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_darwin_amd64.zip
unzip terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_darwin_amd64.zip -d terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64
rm terraform-provider-ssh_v0.0.4_darwin_amd64.zip
terraform init
```

#### Applying an output file

Note that there is a gotcha when trying to apply a generated plan output file (see [issue #1](https://github.com/stefansundin/terraform-provider-ssh/issues/1)). In this case, the SSH tunnels will not be automatically opened.

As a workaround, before you apply, run the companion program `terraform-open-ssh-tunnels` on the plan file first in order to reopen the SSH tunnels. [Download from the releases.](https://github.com/stefansundin/terraform-provider-ssh/releases/latest)

Because of [this commit](https://github.com/stefansundin/terraform-provider-ssh/commit/37fa9835b75fde095c863fca89e2f28a0169919d), only the SSH agent is currently supported in this program. Let me know if you can think of a good fix for this.

#### TODO

- Support another hop (ProxyJump-like behavior)
- Note that the Windows binary is completely untested!

#### Building

```
$ go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
$ make
```
